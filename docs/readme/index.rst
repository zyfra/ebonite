Ebonite is a framework for machine learning lifecycle. For now, it's
main focus is on model deployment, but in future it will cover more
areas.

Ebonite consists of three main modules and some extensions modules.

.. toctree::
    :glob:

    core
    build
    runtime
    extensions

Ebonite is customizable, and every module has it's own abstractions one can implement.
